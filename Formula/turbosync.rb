  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      TurboSync.app has been installed to:
        #{opt_prefix}/TurboSync.app

      To make it easily accessible from your Applications folder, you can link it:
        ln -sfn "#{opt_prefix}/TurboSync.app" /Applications/TurboSync.app

      Alternatively, you can drag the TurboSync.app icon from the installation directory
      (open "#{opt_prefix}") to your /Applications folder.
